<h4><p> What is english </p>

    Today, English is the main language of the United Kingdom, Ireland, the United States of America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and more than fifty other countries. (Interestingly, until as recently as 2017 English was NOT the official language of the USA, although it had long been the official language of several US states.)

Worldwide, there are over 400 million native speakers of English, and over one billion more people speak it as a second language. English is probably the third language in terms of number of native speakers (after Mandarin and Spanish); and probably the most widely spoken language on the planet taking into account native and non-native speakers.

<b>Q 1.</b> what is the value of work?<br> 

</p>

<hr>
<b> Answer 1: </b>
<p> 
    Work values are beliefs or principles relating to your career or place of work. They describe what you believe matters regarding your career.

    For instance, some people believe that getting a sense of achievement through their work is a core priority in their career. For others, a healthy work-life balance trumps anything else.
    
    Employees typically have their own set of core values, but so will organizations. For example, some companies value transparency, while others will see value in teamwork and communication.
    
    Your workplace values say a lot about who you are and what matters to you. This is not just for your career, but in your overall personality, too.

<b>Q2:</b>life of lla scachine

<b>Answer 2.</b>
   <br>
   <b>1</b> 
   When you enter a tiny room in Moti Vavdi 
   village, Bhavnagar, Gujarat, you will see 
   lots of bright colours. There are many 
   lovely things like cushions, bedcovers, 
   pillows, and more, with beautiful designs. 
   Ila Sachani, a wonderful lady with a big 
   smile, makes all these using a shiny needle 
   to create these designs. She is very good at 
   Kathiawar embroidery—a style that needs 
   a lot of skill.
   <br>

   <b>2</b>
   Ila Sachani’s journey began in the quiet 
   settings of Amreli, Gujarat, where she 
   was born into a farmer’s family. From the 
   beginning, life presented its challenges, 
   as Ila was born with her hands hanging 
   loose by her sides. Unlike other children, 
   she could not use her hands in the usual 
   way. While other small hands drew figures 
   in the sand or plucked wild flowers, she 
   wondered why she could not join them. 
   She too wanted to hold a chalk in her hands 
   and draw figures on a slate.
    <br>
    <b>3</b>
    Ila’s mother and grandmother 
encouraged the little girl and 
were single-minded to help her 
overcome her challenge. They 
were skilled in the traditional art 
of Kathiawar embroidery and 
decided to share this art with Ila. 
They taught her to create manybeautiful patterns using her feet! It was 
certainly not an easy task, but Ila accepted 
the challenge with determination. Her 
parents also helped her learn to do things 
with her legs, like eating and combing her 
hair. 
        <br>
        <b>4</b>
        Threading a needle was hard, but Ila did 
not give up and became an expert at a 
young age. Her younger brother and sister 
helped her too. She learned many styles, 
even ones from outside Gujarat—Kachhi, 
Kashmiri, Lucknawi and others.
            <br>
            <b>5</b>
            For Ila, embroidery became a way to express 
            herself. At first, she crafted fine designs 
            only for her family and friends, who were 
            awestruck by her talent. They talked about 
            those designs to others. Soon, the people in 
            the village, too, discovered Ila’s special skill 
            and the admiration for her work began to 
            spread.
            <br>
            <b>6</b>
            Word reached the government office, in 
Surat. They were moved by Ila’s story and 
impressed by her work. They decided to 
display some samples of her embroidery 
at a state exhibition. This experience 
opened new doors for Ila. People observed 
the beauty woven by her feet and readily 
purchased the creations. Ila was no more a 
hidden talent, but famous! 
            <br>
            <b>7</b>
            Encouraged by this popularity, Ila 
            participated in more exhibitions, not just 
            within the state but at the national level. 
            She received many awards and honours, 
            not just for her art but also the willpower 
            and creativity that her work showed. Ila 
            Sachani, once a farmer’s daughter facing a 
            tough challenge, worked hard and became 
            a celebrated artist and receiver of the 
            President’s Medal.
            <br>
            <b>8</b>
            The most important change for Ila was 
the new independence. Through her skill, 
she not only earned a regular income but 
also found joy in doing what she loved. 
She proved, through her creations, that 
challenges can be turned into victories 
with focus, hard work, positivity and never 
giving up.
            <br>
            <b>9</b>
            . Her embroidery, created with her feet, 
reminds us that art has the power to rise 
above physical boundaries and touch 
the soul.
