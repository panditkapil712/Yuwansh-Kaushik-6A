<b>Q 1.</b>  Study India's contribution to satellite
technology through projects like GSAT
(communication satellites) or NAVIC (India's
regional GPS system).<br> 

</p>

<hr>
<b> Answer 1: </b>
<p> 
    Abstract – Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) has launched more than hundred satellites for various applications like communication, Earth observation, Astronomy, Navigation, Lunar studies and interplanetary mission from its inception. Addition to its own programmes, it induced Indian student community to make satellites by guiding, providing facilities to test the subsystems and satellites. It also launches these satellites by Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV). The student satellite projects provide the design, fabrication, assembly and testing experience of electrical and mechanical systems to university students. It provides experience in project management, budget, schedule and mission planning & operation also. Indian students have launched more than nine satellites so far and some more are under development. Due to this inspiration many Universities/Colleges had flown their satellites through balloons for testing their capabilities. Some students launched their satellites through other space agencies also. This paper presents the salient features of these satellites and technologies used in Indian Student satellites.

    <B>Sophisticated Imaging Technology:</B>
    
     INSAT satellites such as 3D and 3DR are equipped with RGB imagers, which play a crucial role in identifying various meteorological phenomena. They do this by analysing solar reflectance and brightness temperature across different wavelengths.
    Geostationary Orbit Positioning: Positioned in geostationary orbits, INSAT 3D and 3DR consistently cover the Indian region, providing vital, continuous weather monitoring.
    <br>
    <b>Round-the-Clock Weather Tracking:</b>
     These satellites feature ‘day microphysics’ and ‘night microphysics’ capabilities, enabling them to track weather changes throughout the day and night for more thorough surveillance.
     <br>
     <b> Distinguishing Snow and Clouds:</b>
    INSAT satellites are adept at differentiating between snow and clouds based on their specific spectral reflectance, which is key for precise weather forecasting.
    <br>
    <b>Improved Weather Forecasting Accuracy</b>
     Utilising both daytime and nighttime data, these satellites aid in better tracking of cyclones and thunderstorms, thereby improving early warning systems.
     <br>
     <B> Enhanced Radiometer Features:</B>
     Newer satellites like INSAT 3DR are equipped with upgraded radiometers, offering higher spatial resolution and better functionality than earlier versions like Kalpana 1 and INSAT 3A.
     <br>
     <b>Detailed Atmospheric Analysis:</b>
     The atmospheric sounders on these satellites measure temperature, humidity, and water vapour levels, providing comprehensive atmospheric profiles crucial for weather analysis.
     <br>
     <b>Technological Advancements in New Satellites:</b>
     Each new satellite in the INSAT series, including INSAT 3DR, comes with advanced features like an improved VHRR, sounder, and additional transponders, continually enhancing India’s weather monitoring capabilities.
